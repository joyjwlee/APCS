# APCS @ LGHS

Labs and code for AP Computer Science A at Los Gatos High School, taught by Mr. Holm

## **About**

- All of the code in this repository is written by [me](https://github.com/joyjwlee) for APCS A
- It contains all labs and material covered in the class, as well as some additional side projects
- This is meant for student reference only, as well as my desire to store it on GitHub

## **IDE / Code Editor**

1. Semester 1: Must use [BlueJ](https://bluej.org/), no matter what
2. Semester 2: Free to choose -- I personally used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## **Warning**

I am NOT responsible if you are:

- held responsible for plagiarism
- copy my code then fail your quizzes, tests, AP exam, etc.

Please use it for reference only, as it was intended, not as a place where you can copy+paste free answers

## **Acknowledgements**

- Mr. Holm for teaching the course
- Classmates for keeping the class fun
